	// define a react component class 
		// needs to be instantiated first, then rendered
		// example: cookie cutter is useless at first, only useful when we place it over the dough and make a cut 
		// the class here is the cookie cutter, describes the form and function of a component, but it cannot itself be rendered to the dom 
		// we must first instantiate the class, make a copy of the class, and then render that copy 
		var HelloWorld = React.createClass({ // React library was used to create the class 
			render: function() {
				return <div> Hello World! </div>
			}
		}); // the cookie cutter 

	// ask react to render this class 
		var element = React.createElement(HelloWorld); // the cookie cutout 

	// when we ask react to render this class, we will tell it where to place the 
	// rendered element in the DOM
		ReactDOM.render(element, document.body); // ReactDOM library was used to render the instantiated class
